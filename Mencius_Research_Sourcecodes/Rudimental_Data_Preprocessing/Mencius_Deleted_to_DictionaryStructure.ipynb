likewise find pleasure in these things Mencius replied They do and if people generally are not able to enjoy themselves they condemn their superiors For them when they cannot enjoy themselves to condemn their superiors is wrong but when the superiors of the people do not make enjoyment a thing common to the people and themselves they also do wrong When a ruler rejoices in the joy of his people they also rejoice in his joy when he grieves at the sorrow of his people they also grieve at his sorrow A sympathy of joy will pervade the kingdom a sympathy of sorrow will do the same · in such a state of things it cannot be but that the ruler attain to the royal dignity Formerly the duke Jing of Qi asked the minister Yan saying I wish to pay a visit of inspection to Zhuan Fu and Chao Wu and then to bend my course southward along the shore till I come to Lang Xie What shall I do that my tour may be fit to be compared with the visits of inspection made by the ancient sovereigns The minister Yan replied An excellent inquiry When the Son of Heaven visited the princes it was called a tour of inspection that is be surveyed the States under their care When the princes attended at the court of the Son of Heaven it was called a report of office that is they reported their administration of their offices Thus neither of the proceedings was without a purpose And moreover in the spring they examined the ploughing and supplied any deficiency of seed in the autumn they examined the reaping and supplied any deficiency of yield There is the saying of the Xia dynasty · If our king do not take his ramble what will become of our happiness If our king do not make his excursion what will become of our help That ramble and that excursion were a pattern to the princes Now the state of things is different A host marches in attendance on the ruler and stores of provisions are consumed The hungry are deprived of their food and there is no rest for those who are called to toil Maledictions are uttered by one to another with eyes askance and the people proceed to the commission of wickedness Thus the royal ordinances are violated and the people are oppressed and the supplies of food and drink flow away like water The rulers yield themselves to the current or they urge their way against it they are wild they are utterly lost · these things proceed to the grief of the inferior princes Descending along with the current and forgetting to return is what I call yielding to it Pressing up against it and forgetting to return is what I call urging their way against it Pursuing the chase without satiety is what I call being wild Delighting in wine without satiety is what I call being lost The ancient sovereigns had no pleasures to which they gave themselves as on the flowing stream no doings which might be so characterized as wild and lost It is for you my prince to pursue your course The duke Ching was pleased He issued a proclamation throughout his State and went out and occupied a shed in the borders From that time he began to open his granaries to supply the wants of the people and calling the Grand music·master he said to him Make for me music to suit

replied The Hall of Distinction is a Hall appropriate to the sovereigns If your Majesty wishes to practise the true royal government then do not pull it down The king said May I hear from you what the true royal government is Formerly was the reply king Wens government of Qi was as follows The husbandmen cultivated for the government one·ninth of the land the descendants of officers were salaried at the passes and in the markets strangers were inspected but goods were not taxed there were no prohibitions respecting the ponds and weirs the wives and children of criminals were not involved in their guilt There were the old and wifeless or widowers the old and husbandless or widows the old and childless or solitaries the young and fatherless or orphans · these four classes are the most destitute of the people and have none to whom they can tell their wants and king Wen in the institution of his government with its benevolent action made them the first objects of his regard as it is said in the Book of Poetry The rich may get through life well But alas for the miserable and solitary The king said O excellent words Mencius said Since your Majesty deems them excellent why do you not practise them I have an infirmity said the king I am fond of wealth The reply was Formerly Gong Liu was fond of wealth It is said in the Book of Poetry He reared his ricks and filled his granaries He tied up dried provisions and grain In bottomless bags and sacks That he might gather his people together and glorify his State With bows and arrows all·displayed With shields and spears and battle·axes large and small He commenced his march In this way those who remained in their old seat had their ricks and granaries and those who marched had their bags of provisions It was not till after this that he thought he could begin his march If your Majesty loves wealth give the people power to gratify the same feeling and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway The king said I have an infirmity I am fond of beauty The reply was Formerly king Tai was fond of beauty and loved his wife It is said in the Book of Poetry Gu Gong Tan Fu Came in the morning galloping his horse By the banks of the western waters As far as the foot of Qi hill Along with the lady of Jiang They came and together chose the site for their settlement At that time in the seclusion of the house there were no dissatisfied women and abroad there were no unmarried men If your Majesty loves beauty let the people be able to gratify the same feeling and what difficulty will

should cast him off Mencius proceeded Suppose that the chief criminal judge could not regulate the officers under him how would you deal with him The king said Dismiss him Mencius again said If within the four borders of your kingdom there is not good government what is to be done The king looked to the right and left and spoke of other matters',\n"," 'Mencius having an interview with the king Xuan

Your Majesty has no intimate ministers even Those whom you advanced yesterday are gone to·day and you do not know it The king said How shall I know that they have not ability and so avoid employing them at all The reply was The ruler of a State advances to office men of talents and virtue only as a matter of necessity Since he will thereby cause the low to overstep the honourable and distant to overstep his near relatives ought he to do so but with caution When all those about you say This is a man of talents and worth you may not therefore believe it When your great officers all say This is a man of talents and virtue neither may you for that believe it When all the people say This is a man of talents and virtue then examine into the case and when you find that the man is such employ him

so in the records The king said May a minister then put his sovereign to death Mencius said He who outrages the benevolence proper to his nature is called a robber he who outrages righteousness is called a ruffian The robber and ruffian we call a mere fellow I have heard of the cutting off of the fellow Zhou but I have not heard of the putting a sovereign to death in his case',\n"," 'The people of Qi attacked Yan and conquered it The king Xuan asked saying Some tell me not to take possession of it for myself and some tell me to take possession of it For a kingdom of ten thousand chariots attacking another of ten thousand chariots to complete the conquest of it in fifty days is an achievement beyond mere human strength If I do not take possession of it calamities from Heaven will surely come upon me What do you say to my taking possession of it Mencius replied If the people of Yan will be pleased with your taking possession of it then do so Among the ancients there was one who acted on this principle namely king Wu If the people of Yan will not be pleased with your taking possession of it then do not do so Among the ancients there was one who acted on this principle namely king Wen When with all the strength of your country of ten thousand chariots you attacked another country of ten thousand chariots and the people brought baskets of rice and vessels of congee to meet your Majestys host was there any other reason for this but that they hoped to escape out of fire and water If you make the water more deep and the fire more fierce they will in like manner make another revolution',\n"," 'The people of Qi having smitten Yan took possession of it and upon this the princes of the various States deliberated together and resolved to deliver Yan from their power

of government throughout the kingdom That was Tang I have never heard of a prince with a thousand li standing in fear of others It is said in the Book of History As soon as Tang began his work of executing justice he commenced with Ge The whole kingdom had confidence in him When he pursued his work in the east the rude tribes on the west murmured So did those on the north when he was engaged in the south Their cry was Why does he put us last Thus the people looked to him as we look in a time of great drought to the clouds and rainbows The frequenters of the markets stopped not The husbandmen made no change in their operations While he punished their rulers he consoled the people His progress was like the falling of opportune rain and the people were delighted It is said again

brothers and put their sons and younger brothers in confinement You have pulled down the ancestral temple of the State and are removing to Qi its precious vessels How can such a course be deemed proper The rest of the kingdom is indeed jealously afraid of the strength of Qi and now when with a doubled territory you do not put in practice a benevolent government · it is this which sets the arms of the kingdom in in motion If your Majesty will make haste to issue an ordinance restoring your captives old and young stopping the removal of the precious vessels and saying that after

Meng Ke the duke said One told me that on the occasion of the scholar Mengs second mourning his observances exceeded those of the former It is on that account that I have not gone to see him How is this answered Yue Zheng By what you call exceeding you mean I suppose that on the first occasion he used the rites appropriate to a scholar and on the second those appropriate to a great officer that he first used three tripods and afterwards five tripods The duke said No I refer to the greater excellence of the coffin the shell the grave·clothes and the shroud Yue·zheng said That cannot be called exceeding That was the difference between being poor and being rich After this Yue Zheng saw Mencius and said to him I told the prince about you and he was consequently coming to see you when one of his favourites named Zang Cang stopped him and therefore he did not come according to his purpose Mencius said A mans advancement is effected it may be by others and the stopping him is it may be from the efforts of others But to advance a man or to stop his advance is really beyond the power of other men My not finding in the prince of Lu a ruler who would confide in me and put my counsels into

and on the wilds there are those who have died of famine This is leading on beasts to devour men Beasts devour one another and men hate them for doing so When a prince being the parent of his people

their account to wipe it away once for all What course is to be pursued to accomplish this Mencius replied With a territory which is only a hundred li square it is possible to attain to the royal dignity If Your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people being sparing in the use of punishments and fines and making the taxes and levies light so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep and the weeding of them be carefully attended to and that the strong·bodied during their days of leisure shall cultivate their filial piety fraternal respectfulness sincerity

'1·7': 'The king Xuan of Qi asked saying May I be informed by you of the transactions of Huan of Qi and Wen of Jin Mencius replied There were none of the disciples of Zhong Ni who spoke about the affairs of Huan and Wen and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after·ages · your servant has not heard them If you will have me speak let it be about royal government The king said What virtue must there be in order to attain to royal sway Mencius answered The love and protection of the people with this there is no power which can prevent a ruler from attaining to it The king asked again Is such an one as I competent to love and protect the people Mencius said Yes How do you know that I am competent for that I heard the following incident from Hu He The king said he was sitting aloft in the hall when a man appeared leading an ox past the lower part of it The king saw him and asked Where is the ox going The man replied We are going to consecrate a bell with its blood The king said Let it go I cannot bear its frightened appearance as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death The man answered Shall we then omit the consecration of the bell The king said How can that be omitted Change it for a sheep I do not know whether this incident really occurred The king replied It did and then Mencius said The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the royal sway The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal but your servant knows surely that it was your Majestys not being able to bear the sight which made you do as you did The king said You are right And yet there really was an appearance of what the people condemned But though Qi be a small and narrow State how should I grudge one ox Indeed it was because I could not bear its frightened appearance as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death that therefore I changed it for a sheep Mencius pursued Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you were grudging the animal When you changed a large one for a small how should they know the true reason If you felt pained by its being led without guilt to the place of death what was there to choose between an ox and a sheep The king laughed and said What really was my mind in the matter I did not grudge the expense of it and changed it for a sheep There was reason in the peoples saying that I grudged it There is no harm in their saying so said Mencius Your conduct was an artifice of benevolence You saw the ox and had not seen the sheep So is the superior man affected towards animals that having seen them alive he cannot bear to see them die having heard their dying cries he cannot bear to eat their flesh Therefore he keeps away from his slaughter·house and cook·room The king was pleased and said It is said in the Book of Poetry The minds of others I am able by reflection to measure · this is verified my Master in your discovery of my motive I indeed did the thing but when I turned my thoughts inward and examined into it I could not discover my own mind When you Master spoke those words the movements of compassion began to work in my mind How is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the royal sway Mencius replied Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties but it is not sufficient to lift one feather my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair but I do not see a waggon·load of faggots would your Majesty allow what he said No was the answer on which Mencius proceeded Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals and no benefits are extended from it to the people How is this Is an exception to be made here The truth is the feather is not lifted because strength is not used the waggon·load of firewood is not seen because the eyesight is not used and the people are not loved and protected because kindness is not employed Therefore your Majestys not exercising the royal sway is because you do not do it not because you are not able to do it The king asked How may the difference between the not doing a thing and the not being able to do it be represented Mencius repliedIn such a thing as taking the Tai mountain under your arm and leaping over the north sea with it if you say to people I am not able to do it that is a real case of not being able In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior if you say to people I am not able to do it that is a case of not doing it it is not a case of not being able to do it Therefore your Majestys not exercising the royal sway is not such a case as that of taking the Tai mountain under your arm and leaping over the north sea with it Your Majestys not exercising the royal sway is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree Treat with the reverence due to age the elders in your own family so that the elders in the families of others shall be similarly treated treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family so that the young in the families of others shall be similarly treated · do this and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm It is said in the Book of Poetry His example affected his wife It reached to his brothers and his family of the State was governed by itThe language shows how king Wen simply took his kindly heart and exercised it towards those parties Therefore the carrying out his kindness of heart by a prince will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas and if he do not carry it out he will not be able to protect his wife and children The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men was no other but this · simply that they knew well how to carry out so as to affect others what they themselves did Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals and no benefits are extended from it to reach the people How is this Is an exception to be made here By weighing we know what things are light and what heavy By measuring we know what things are long and what short The relations of all things may be thus determined and it is of the greatest importance to estimate the motions of the mind I beg your Majesty to measure it You collect your equipments of war endanger your soldiers and officers and excite the resentment of the other princes · do these things cause you pleasure in your mind The king replied No How should I derive pleasure from these things My object in them is to seek for what I greatly desire Mencius said May I hear from you what it is that you greatly desire The king laughed and did not speak Mencius resumed Are you led to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth Or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body Or because you have not enough of beautifully coloured objects to delight your eyes Or because you have not voices and tones enough to please your ears Or because you have not enough of attendants and favourites to stand before you and receive your orders Your Majestys various officers are sufficient to supply you with those things How can your Majesty be led to entertain such a desire on account of them No said the king my desire is not on account of them Mencius added Then what your Majesty greatly desires may be known You wish to enlarge your territories to have Qin and Chu wait at your court to rule the Middle Kingdom and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround it But doing what you do to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish The king said Is it so bad as that It is even worse was the reply If you climb a tree to seek for fish although you do not get the fish you will not suffer any subsequent calamity But doing what you do to seek for what you desire doing it moreover with all your heart you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities The king asked May I hear from you the proof of that Mencius said If the people of Zou should fight with the people of Chu which of them does your Majesty think would conquer The people of Chu would conquer Yes · and so it is certain that a small country cannot contend with a great that few cannot contend with many that the weak cannot contend with the strong The territory within the four seas embraces nine divisions each of a thousand li square All Qi together is but one of them If with one part you try to subdue the other eight what is the difference between that and Zous contending with Chu For with such a desire you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment Now if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall be benevolent this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majestys court and all the farmers to wish to plough in your Majestys fields and all the merchants both travelling and stationary to wish to store their goods in your Majestys market·places and all travelling strangers to wish to make their tours on your Majestys roads and all throughout the kingdom who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty And when they are so bent who will be able to keep them back The king said I am stupid and not able to advance to this I wish you my Master to assist my intentions Teach me clearly although I am deficient in intelligence and vigour I will essay and try to carry your instructions into effect Mencius replied They are only men of education who without a certain livelihood are able to maintain a fixed heart As to the people if they have not a certain livelihood it follows that they will not have a fixed heart And if they have not a fixed heart there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self·abandonment of moral deflection of depravity and of wild license When they thus have been involved in crime to follow them up and punish them · this is to entrap the people How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man Therefore an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people so as to make sure that for those above them they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents and for those below them sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied and that in bad years they shall escape the danger of perishing After this he may urge them and they will proceed to what is good for in this case the people will follow after it with ease Now the livelihood of the people is so regulated that above they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents and below they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children Notwithstanding good years their lives are continually embittered and in bad years they do not escape perishing In such circumstances they only try to save themselves from death and are afraid they will not succeed What leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness If your Majesty wishes to effect this regulation of the livelihood of the people why not turn to that which is the essential step to it Let mulberry·trees be planted about the homesteads with their five mu and persons of fifty years may be clothed with silk In keeping fowls pigs dogs and swine let not their times of breeding be neglected and persons of seventy years may eat flesh Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the farm with its hundred mu and the family of eight mouths that is supported by it shall not suffer from hunger Let careful attention be paid to education in schools the inculcation in it especially of the filial and fraternal duties and grey·haired men will not be seen upon the roads carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads It never has been that the ruler of a State where such results were seen the old wearing silk and eating flesh and the black·haired people

square li but the grass·cutters and fuel·gatherers had the privilege of entrance into it so also had the catchers of pheasants and hares He shared it with the people and was it not with reason that they looked on it as small When I first arrived at the borders of your kingdom I inquired about the great prohibitory regulations before I would venture to enter it and I heard that inside the barrier·gates there was a park of forty square l and that he who killed a deer in it was held guilty of the same crime as if he had killed a man Thus those forty square li are a pitfall in the middle of the kingdom Is it not with reason that the people look upon them as large', 'The king Xuan of Qi had an interview with Mencius in the Snow palace and said to him Do men of talents and worth likewise find pleasure in these things Mencius replied They do and if people generally are not able to enjoy themselves they condemn their superiors For them when they cannot enjoy themselves to condemn their superiors is wrong but when the superiors of the people do not make enjoyment a thing common to the people and themselves they also do wrong When a ruler rejoices in the joy of his people they also rejoice in his joy when he grieves at the sorrow of his people they also grieve at his sorrow A sympathy of joy will pervade the kingdom a sympathy of sorrow will do the same · in such a state of things it cannot be but that the ruler attain to the royal dignity Formerly the duke Jing of Qi asked the minister Yan saying I wish to pay a visit of inspection to Zhuan Fu and Chao Wu and then to bend my course southward along the shore till I come to Lang Xie What shall I do that my tour may be fit to be compared with the visits of inspection made by the ancient sovereigns The minister Yan replied An excellent inquiry When the Son of Heaven visited the princes it was called a tour of inspection that is be surveyed the States under their care When the princes attended at the court of the Son of Heaven it was called a report of office that is they reported their administration of their offices Thus neither of the proceedings was without a purpose And moreover in the spring they examined the ploughing and supplied any deficiency of seed in the autumn they examined the reaping and supplied any deficiency of yield There is the saying of the Xia dynasty · If our king do not take his ramble what will become of our happiness If our king do not make his excursion what will become of our help That ramble and that excursion were a pattern to the princes Now the state of things is different A host marches in attendance on the ruler and stores of provisions are consumed The hungry are deprived of their food and there is no rest for those who are called to toil Maledictions are uttered by one to another with eyes askance and the people proceed to the commission of wickedness Thus the royal ordinances are violated and the people are oppressed and the supplies of food and drink flow away like water The rulers yield themselves to the current or they urge their way against it they are wild they are utterly lost · these things proceed to the grief of the inferior princes Descending along with the current and forgetting to return is what I call yielding to it Pressing up against it and forgetting to return is what I call urging their way against it Pursuing the chase without satiety is what I call being wild Delighting in wine without satiety is what I call being lost The ancient sovereigns had no pleasures to which they gave themselves as on the flowing stream no doings which might be so characterized as wild and lost It is for you my prince to pursue your course The duke Ching was pleased He issued a proclamation throughout his State and went out and occupied a shed in the borders From that time he began to open his granaries to supply the wants of the people and calling the Grand music·master he said to him Make for me music to suit

Hall of Distinction is a Hall appropriate to the sovereigns If your Majesty wishes to practise the true royal government then do not pull it down The king said May I hear from you what the true royal government is Formerly was the reply king Wens government of Qi was as follows The husbandmen cultivated for the government one·ninth of the land the descendants of officers were salaried at the passes and in the markets strangers were inspected but goods were not taxed there were no prohibitions respecting the ponds and weirs the wives and children of criminals were not involved in their guilt There were the old and wifeless or widowers the old and husbandless or widows the old and childless or solitaries the young and fatherless or orphans · these four classes are the most destitute of the people and have none to whom they can tell their wants and king Wen in the institution of his government with its benevolent action made them the first objects of his regard as it is said in

after this that he thought he could begin his march If your Majesty loves wealth give the people power to gratify the same feeling and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway The king said I have an infirmity I am fond of beauty The reply was Formerly king Tai was fond of beauty and loved his wife It is said in the Book of Poetry Gu Gong Tan Fu Came in the morning galloping his horse By the banks of the western waters As far as the foot of Qi hill Along with the lady of Jiang They came and together chose the site for their settlement At that time in the seclusion of the house there were no dissatisfied women and abroad there were no unmarried men If your Majesty loves beauty let the people be able to gratify the same feeling and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway', 'Mencius said to the king Xuan of Qi Suppose that one of your Majestys ministers were to entrust his wife and children to the care of his friend while he himself went into Chu to travel and that on his return he should find that the friend had let his wife and children suffer from cold and hunger · how ought he to deal with him The king said He should cast him off Mencius proceeded Suppose that the chief criminal judge could not regulate the officers under him how would you deal with him The king said Dismiss him Mencius again said If within the four borders of your kingdom there is not good government what is to be done The king looked to the right and left and spoke of other matters', 'Mencius having an interview with the king Xuan of Qi said to him When men speak of an ancient kingdom it is not meant thereby that it has lofty trees in it but that it has ministers sprung from families which have been noted in it for generations Your Majesty has no intimate ministers even Those whom you advanced yesterday are gone to·day and you do not know it The king said How shall I know that they have not ability and so avoid employing them at all The reply was The ruler of a State advances to office men of talents and virtue only as a matter of necessity Since he will thereby cause the low to overstep the honourable and distant to overstep his near relatives ought he to do so but with caution When all those about you say This is a man of talents and worth you may not therefore believe it When your great officers all say This is a man of talents and virtue neither may you for that believe it When all the people say This is a man of talents and virtue then examine into the case and when you find that the man is such employ him When all those about you say This man wont do dont listen to them When all your great officers say This man wont do dont listen to them When the people all say This man wont do then examine into the case and when you find that the man wont do send him away When all those about you say This man deserves death dont listen to them When all your great officers say This man deserves death dont listen to them When the people all say This man deserves death then inquire into the case and when you see that the man deserves death put him to death In accordance with this we have the saying The people killed him You must act in this way in order to be the parent of the people', 'The king Xuan of Qi asked saying Was it so that Tang banished Jie and that king Wu smote Zhou Mencius replied It is so in the records The king said May a minister then put his sovereign to death Mencius said He who outrages the benevolence proper to his nature is called a robber he who outrages righteousness is called a ruffian The robber and ruffian we call a mere fellow I have heard of the cutting off of the fellow Zhou but I have not heard of the putting a sovereign to death in his case', 'The people of Qi attacked Yan and conquered it The king Xuan asked saying Some tell me not to take possession of it for myself and some tell me to take possession of it For a kingdom of ten thousand chariots attacking another of ten thousand chariots to complete the conquest of it in fifty days is an achievement beyond mere human strength If I do not take possession of it calamities from Heaven will surely come upon me What do you say to my taking possession of it Mencius replied If the people of Yan will be pleased with your taking possession of it then do so Among the ancients there was one who acted on this principle namely king Wu If the people of Yan will not be pleased with your taking possession of it then do not do so Among the ancients there was one who acted on this principle namely king Wen When with all the strength of your country of ten thousand chariots you attacked another country of ten thousand chariots and the people brought baskets of rice and vessels of congee to meet your Majestys host was there any other reason for this but that they hoped to escape out of fire and water If you make the water more deep and the fire more fierce they will in like manner make another revolution', 'The people of Qi having smitten Yan took possession of it and upon this the princes of the various States deliberated together and resolved to deliver Yan from their power The king Xuan said to Mencius The princes have formed many plans to attack me · how shall I prepare myself for them Mencius replied I have heard of one who with seventy li exercised all the functions of government throughout the kingdom That was Tang I have never heard of a prince with a thousand li standing in fear of others It is said in the Book of History As soon as Tang began his work of executing justice he commenced with Ge The whole kingdom had confidence in him When he pursued his work in the east the rude tribes on the west murmured So did those on the north when he was engaged in the south Their cry was Why does he put us last Thus the people looked to him as we look in a time of great drought to the clouds and rainbows The frequenters of the markets stopped not The husbandmen made no change in their operations While he punished their rulers he consoled the people His progress was like the falling of opportune rain and the people were delighted It is said again in the Book of History We have waited for our prince long the princes coming will be our reviving Now the ruler of Yan was tyrannizing over his people and your Majesty went and punished him The people supposed that you were going to deliver them out of the water and the fire and brought baskets of rice and vessels of congee to meet your Majestys host But you have slain their fathers and elder brothers and put their sons and younger brothers in confinement You have pulled down the ancestral temple of the State and are removing to Qi its precious vessels How can such a course be deemed proper The rest of the kingdom is indeed jealously afraid of the strength of Qi and now when with a doubled territory you do not put in practice a benevolent government · it is this which sets the arms of the kingdom in in motion If your Majesty will make haste to issue an ordinance restoring your captives old and young stopping the removal of the precious vessels and saying that after consulting with the people of Yen you will appoint them a ruler and withdraw from the country · in this way you may still be able to stop the threatened attack', 'There had been a brush between Zou and Lu when the duke Mu asked Mencius sayingOf my officers there were killed thirty·three men and none of the people would die in their defence Though I sentenced them to death for their conduct it is impossible to put such a multitude to death If I do not put them to death then there is the crime unpunished of their looking angrily on at the death of their officers and not saving them How is the exigency of the case to be met Mencius replied In calamitous years and years of famine the old and weak of your people who have been found lying in the ditches and water·channels and the able·bodied who have been scattered about to the four quarters have amounted to several thousands All the while your granaries 0 prince have been stored with grain and your treasuries and arsenals have been full and not one of your officers has told you of the distress Thus negligent have the superiors in your State been and cruel to their inferiors The philosopher Zeng said Beware beware What proceeds from you will return to you again Now at length the people have paid back the conduct of their officers to them Do not you O prince blame them If you will put in practice a benevolent government this people will love you and all above them and will die for their officers', 'The duke Ping of Lu was about to leave his palace when his favourite one Zang Cang made a request to him saying On other days when you have gone out you have given instructions to the officers as to where you were going But now the horses have been put to the carriage and the officers do not yet know where you are going I venture to ask The duke said I am going to see the scholar Meng How is this said the other That you demean yourself prince in paying the honour of the first visit to a common man is I suppose because you think that he is a man of talents and virtue By such men the rules of ceremonial proprieties and right are observed But on the occasion of this Mengs second mourning his observances exceeded those of the former Do not go to see him my prince The duke said I will not The officer Yue Zheng entered the court and had an audience He said Prince why have you not gone to see Meng Ke the duke said One told me that on the occasion of the scholar Mengs second mourning his observances exceeded those of the former It is on that account that I have not gone to see him How is this answered Yue Zheng By what you call exceeding you mean I suppose that on the first occasion he used the rites appropriate to a scholar and on the second those appropriate to a great officer that he first used three tripods and afterwards five tripods The duke said No I refer to the greater excellence of the coffin the shell the grave·clothes and the shroud Yue·zheng said That cannot be called exceeding That was the difference between being poor and being rich After this Yue Zheng saw Mencius and said to him I told the prince about you and he was consequently coming to see you when one of his favourites named Zang Cang stopped him and therefore he did not come according to his purpose Mencius said A mans advancement is effected it may be by others and the stopping him is it may be from the efforts of others But to advance a man or to stop his advance is really beyond the power of other men My not finding in the prince of Lu a ruler who would confide in me and put my counsels into practice is from Heaven How could that scion of the Zang family cause me not to find the ruler that would suit me III Gong Sun Chou I'])"]},"execution_count":36,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["mencius_data_structure['II']['Liang
