there is any prince who exerts his mind as I do And yet the people of the neighboring kingdoms do not decrease nor do my people increase How is this Mencius replied Your majesty is fond of war · let me take an illustration from war The soldiers move forward to the sound of the drums and after their weapons have been crossed on one side they throw away their coats of mail trail their arms behind them and run Some run a hundred paces and stop some run fifty paces and stop What would you think if those who run fifty paces were to laugh at those who run a hundred paces The king said They should not do so Though they did not run a hundred paces yet they also ran away Since your Majesty knows this replied Mencius you need not hope that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with the grain will be more than can be eaten If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds the fishes and turtles will be more than can be consumed If the axes and bills enter the hills and forests only at the proper time the wood will be more than can be used When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten and there is more wood than can be used this enables the people to nourish their living and mourn for their dead without any feeling against any This condition in which the people nourish their living and bury their dead without any feeling against any is the first step of royal government Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five mu and persons of fifty years may be clothed with silk In keeping fowls pigs dogs and swine let not their times of breeding be neglected and persons of seventy years may eat flesh Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the farm with its hundred mu and the family of several mouths that is supported by it shall not suffer from hunger Let careful attention be paid to education in schools inculcating in it especially the filial and fraternal duties and grey·haired men will not be seen upon the roads carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads It never has been that the ruler of a State where such results were seen · persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh and the black·haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold · did not attain to the royal dignity Your dogs and swine eat the food of men and you do not make any restrictive arrangements There are people dying from famine on the roads and you do not issue the stores of your granaries for them When people die you say It is not owing to me it is owing to the year In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him and then saying · It was not I it was the weapon Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on

Master of the workmen to look out for large trees and when he has found such large trees you will be glad thinking that they will answer for the intended object Should the workmen hew them so as to make them too small then your Majesty will be angry thinking that they will not answer for the purpose Now a man spends his youth in learning the principles of right government and being grown up to vigour he wishes to put them in practice if your Majesty says to him For the present put aside what you have learned and follow me what shall we say Here now you have a gem unwrought in the stone Although it may be worth 240000 taels you will surely employ a lapidary to cut and polish it But when you come to the government of the State then you say For the present put aside what you have learned and follow me How is it that you herein act so differently from your conduct in calling in the lapidary to cut the gem', 'The duke Wen of Teng asked Mencius saying Teng is a small kingdom and lies between Qi and Chu Shall I serve Qi Or shall I serve Chu Mencius replied This plan which you propose is beyond me If you will have me counsel you there is one thing I can suggest Dig deeper your moats build higher your walls guard them as well as your people In case of attack be prepared to die in your defence and have the people so that they will not leave you · this is a proper course', 'The duke Wen of Teng asked Mencius saying The people of Qi are going to fortify Xue The movement occasions me great alarm What is the proper course for me to take in the case Mencius replied Formerly when king Tai dwelt in Bin the barbarians of the north were continually making incursions upon it He therefore left it went to the foot of mount Qi and there took up his residence He did not take that situation as having selected it It was a matter of necessity with him If you do good among your descendants in after generations there shall be one who will attain to the royal dignity A prince lays the foundation of the inheritance and hands down the beginning which he has made doing what may be continued by his successors As to the accomplishment of the great result that is with Heaven What is that Qi to you O prince Be strong to do good That is all your business', 'The duke Wen of Teng asked Mencius saying Teng is a small State Though I do my utmost to serve those large kingdoms on either side of it we cannot escape suffering from them What course shall I take that we may do so Mencius replied Formerly when king Tai dwelt in Bin the barbarians of the north were constantly making incursions upon it He served them with skins and silks and still he suffered from them He served them with dogs and horses and still he suffered from them He served them with pearls and gems and still he suffered from them Seeing this he assembled the old men and announced to them saying What the barbarians want is my territory I have heard this · that a ruler does not injure his people with that wherewith he nourishes them My children why should you be troubled about having no prince I will leave this Accordingly he left Bin crossed the mountain Liang built a town at the foot of mount Qi and dwelt there The people of Pin said He is a benevolent man We must not lose him Those who followed him looked like crowds hastening to market On the other hand some say The kingdom is a thing to be kept from generation to generation One individual cannot undertake to dispose of it in his own person Let him be prepared to die for it Let him not quit it I ask you prince to make your election
