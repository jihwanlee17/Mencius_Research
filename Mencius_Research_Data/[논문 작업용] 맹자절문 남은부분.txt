King Hui of Liang said, 'Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, I do indeed exert my mind to the utmost.

If the year be bad on the inside of the river, I remove as many of the people as I can to the east of the river, and convey grain to the country in the inside. When the year is bad on the east of the river, I act on the same plan.

On examining the government of the neighboring kingdoms, I do not find that there is any prince who exerts his mind as I do.

And yet the people of the neighboring kingdoms do not decrease, nor do my people increase. How is this?'

Mencius replied, 'Your majesty is fond of war ¡¤ let me take an illustration from war. The soldiers move forward to the sound of the drums; and after their weapons have been crossed, on one side they throw away their coats of mail, trail their arms behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and stop; some run fifty paces and stop. 
ì¤çéä¨ÜÆáÅÛİÜÆ£¬öÎù¼åı£¿¡¹
What would you think if those who run fifty paces were to laugh at those who run a hundred paces?'
èØ£º¡¸ÜôÊ¦£¬òÁÜôÛİÜÆì¼£¬ãÀæ²ñËå¥¡£¡¹
The king said, 'They should not do so. Though they did not run a hundred paces, yet they also ran away.'

'Since your Majesty knows this,' replied Mencius, 'you need not hope that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.

If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fishes and turtles will be more than can be consumed.

If the axes and bills enter the hills and forests only at the proper time, the wood will be more than can be used.

When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and mourn for their dead, without any feeling against any. 
å×ßæßÃŞİÙíÊğ£¬èİÔ³ñıã·å¥¡£
This condition, in which the people nourish their living and bury their dead without any feeling against any, is the first step of royal government.

Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the farm with its hundred mu, and the family of several mouths that is supported by it shall not suffer from hunger.

Let careful attention be paid to education in schools, inculcating in it especially the filial and fraternal duties, and grey¡¤haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads.

It never has been that the ruler of a State, where such results were seen ¡¤ persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black¡¤haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold ¡¤ did not attain to the royal dignity.'

'Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not make any restrictive arrangements. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not issue the stores of your granaries for them.

In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying ¡¤ "It was not I; it was the weapon?"

Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year, and instantly from all the nation the people will come to you.'

The king Xuan of Qi asked, saying, 'Is there any way to regulate one's maintenance of intercourse with neighbouring kingdoms?'

Mencius replied, 'There is. 
êîìÒíºêÓÒöì¤ÓŞŞÀá³£¬ãÀÍº÷·ŞÀÊç£¬ÙşèİŞÀÍàì¨¡£
But it requires a perfectly virtuous prince to be able, with a great country, to serve a small one ¡¤ as, for instance, Tang served Ge, and king Wen served the Kun barbarians.

He who delights in Heaven, will affect with his love and protection the whole kingdom. He who stands in awe of Heaven, will affect with his love and protection his own kingdom.

It is said in the Book of Poetry, "I fear the Majesty of Heaven, and will thus preserve its favouring decree."'
èİèØ£º¡¸ÓŞî£åëëø£¡
The king said,'A great saying!

If a man brandishes his sword, looks fiercely, and says, "How dare he withstand me?" ¡¤

this is the valour of a common man, who can be the opponent only of a single individual.

It is said in the Book of Poetry, "The king blazed with anger, And he marshalled his hosts, To stop the march to Chu, To consolidate the prosperity of Zhou, To meet the expectations of the nation." This was the valour of king Wen. 
ÙşèİìéÒÁì»äÌô¸ù»ñıÚÅ¡£
King Wen, in one burst of his anger, gave repose to all the people of the kingdom.

In the Book of History it is said, "Heaven having produced the inferior people, made for them rulers and teachers, with the purpose that they should be assisting to God, and therefore distinguished them throughout the four quarters of the land. 
êóñªÙíñªêîä²î¤£¬ô¸ù»ÊãÊòêóêÆÏğò¤£¿¡»
Whoever are offenders, and whoever are innocent, here am I to deal with them. How dare any under heaven give indulgence to their refractory wills?" 
ìéìÑû¬ú¼åÚô¸ù»£¬Ùëèİö»ñı£¬ó®Ùëèİñıé¸å¥¡£
There was one man pursuing a violent and disorderly course in the kingdom, and king Wu was ashamed of it. This was the valour of king Wu. 
ì»Ùëèİæ²ìéÒÁì»äÌô¸ù»ñıÚÅ¡£
He also, by one display of his anger, gave repose to all the people of the kingdom.

Let now your Majesty also, in one burst of anger, give repose to all the people of the kingdom. The people are only afraid that your Majesty does not love valour.'

Mencius, having an interview with the king Xuan of Qi, said to him, 'If you are going to build a large mansion, you will surely cause the Master of the workmen to look out for large trees,

Should the workmen hew them so as to make them too small, then your Majesty will be angry, thinking that they will not answer for the purpose.

Now, a man spends his youth in learning the principles of right government, and, being grown up to vigour, he wishes to put them in practice; if your Majesty says to him, "For the present put aside what you have learned, and follow me," what shall we say?

Here now you have a gem unwrought, in the stone. Although it may be worth 240,000 taels, you will surely employ a lapidary to cut and polish it. But when you come to the government of the State, then you say, "For the present put aside what you have learned, and follow me." How is it that you herein act so differently from your conduct in calling in the lapidary to cut the gem?'

The duke Wen of Teng asked Mencius, saying, 'Teng is a small kingdom, and lies between Qi and Chu. Shall I serve Qi? 
ŞÀõ¢ûº£¿¡¹
Or shall I serve Chu?'
Øëí­ÓßèØ£º¡¸ãÀÙÇŞªçîá¶ÒöĞàå¥¡£
Mencius replied, 'This plan which you propose is beyond me.

If you will have me counsel you, there is one thing I can suggest. Dig deeper your moats; build higher your walls; guard them as well as your people.

In case of attack, be prepared to die in your defence, and have the people so that they will not leave you ¡¤ this is a proper course.'

The duke Wen of Teng asked Mencius, saying, 'The people of Qi are going to fortify Xue. The movement occasions me great alarm.

What is the proper course for me to take in the case?'
Øëí­ÓßèØ£º¡¸à®íºÓŞèİËÜ?£¬îÚìÑöÕñı£¬ËÛñıĞ÷ß£ñıù»ËÜåê¡£
Mencius replied, 'Formerly, when king Tai dwelt in Bin, the barbarians of the north were continually making incursions upon it. He therefore left it, went to the foot of mount Qi, and there took up his residence. 
Şª÷Éì»ö¢ñı£¬ÜôÔğì«å¥¡£
He did not take that situation, as having selected it. It was a matter of necessity with him.

A prince lays the foundation of the inheritance, and hands down the beginning which he has made, doing what may be continued by his successors. As to the accomplishment of the great result, that is with Heaven.

The duke Wen of Teng asked Mencius, saying, 'Teng is a small State. Though I do my utmost to serve those large kingdoms on either side of it, we cannot escape suffering from them. What course shall I take that we may do so?'

Mencius replied, 'Formerly, when king Tai dwelt in Bin, the barbarians of the north were constantly making incursions upon it. He served them with skins and silks, and still he suffered from them. He served them with dogs and horses, and still he suffered from them. He served them with pearls and gems, and still he suffered from them.

On the other hand, some say, "The kingdom is a thing to be kept from generation to generation. One individual cannot undertake to dispose of it in his own person. Let him be prepared to die for it. Let him not quit it."

If he require that the husbandmen give their mutual aid to cultivate the public feld, and exact no other taxes from them ¡¤ then all the husbandmen of the kingdom will be pleased, and wish to plough in his fields.

If from the occupiers of the shops in his market¡¤place he do not exact the fine of the individual idler, or of the hamlet's quota of cloth, then all the people of the kingdom will be pleased, and wish to come and be his people.

From the first birth of mankind till now, never has any one led children to attack their parent, and succeeded in his design.

Thus, such a ruler will not have an enemy in all the kingdom, 
ÙíîØåÚô¸ù»íº£¬ô¸×Ùå¥¡£
and he who has no enemy in the kingdom is the minister of Heaven.

Never has there been a ruler in such a case who did not attain to the royal dignity.'

Mencius said, 'All men have a mind which cannot bear to see the sufferings of others. 
à»èİêóÜôìÛìÑñıãı£¬ŞÙêóÜôìÛìÑñıïÙëø¡£
'The ancient kings had this commiserating mind, and they, as a matter of course, had likewise a commiserating government. 
ì¤ÜôìÛìÑñıãı£¬ú¼ÜôìÛìÑñıïÙ£¬ö½ô¸ù»Ê¦ê¡ñıíæß¾¡£
When with a commiserating mind was practised a commiserating government, to rule the kingdom was as easy a matter as to make anything go round in the palm.

When I say that all men have a mind which cannot bear to see the sufferings of others, my meaning may be illustrated thus: even now¡¤a¡¤days, if men suddenly see a child about to fall into a well, they will without exception experience a feeling of alarm and distress. They will feel so, not as a ground on which they may gain the favour of the child's parents, nor as a ground on which they may seek the praise of their neighbours and friends, nor from a dislike to the reputation of having been unmoved by such a thing.

From this case we may perceive that the feeling of commiseration is essential to man, that the feeling of shame and dislike is essential to man, that the feeling of modesty and complaisance is essential to man, and that the feeling of approving and disapproving is essential to man. 
ö³ëßñıãı£¬ìÒñıÓ®å¥£»âºäÂñıãı£¬ëùñıÓ®å¥£»ŞöåÓñıãı£¬ÖÉñıÓ®å¥£»ãÀŞªñıãı£¬òªñıÓ®å¥¡£
The feeling of commiseration is the principle of benevolence. The feeling of shame and dislike is the principle of righteousness. The feeling of modesty and complaisance is the principle of propriety. The feeling of approving and disapproving is the principle of knowledge. 
ìÑñıêóãÀŞÌÓ®å¥£¬ë¢ĞìêóŞÌô÷å¥¡£
Men have these four principles just as they have their four limbs.

When men, having these four principles, yet say of themselves that they cannot develop them, they play the thief with themselves, and he who says of his prince that he cannot develop them plays the thief with his prince.

Since all men have these four principles in themselves, let them know to give them all their development and completion, and the issue will be like that of fire which has begun to burn, or that of a spring which has begun to find vent.

 If a man, in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?"

Now, benevolence is the most honourable dignity conferred by Heaven, and the quiet home in which man should awell. 
Ø°ñıåİì»ÜôìÒ£¬ãÀÜôòªå¥¡£
Since no one can hinder us from being so, if yet we are not benevolent ¡¤ this is being not wise. 
ÜôìÒÜôòª£¬ÙíÖÉÙíëù£¬ìÑæµå¥¡£
From the want of benevolence and the want of wisdom will ensue the entire absence of propriety and righteousness;¡¤¡¤ he who is in such a case must be the servant of other men. 
ìÑæµì»ö»êÓæµ£¬ë¦ÏáìÑì»ö»êÓÏá¡¢ãÅìÑì»ö»êÓãÅå¥¡£
To be the servant of men and yet ashamed of such servitude, is like a bowmaker's being ashamed to make bows, or an arrow¡¤maker's being ashamed to make arrows.

If he be ashamed of his case, his best course is to practise benevolence.

Mencius said, 'Opportunities of time vouchsafed by Heaven are not equal to advantages of situation afforded by the Earth, and advantages of situation afforded by the Earth are not equal to the union arising from the accord of Men.

There is a city, with an inner wall of three li in circumference, and an outer wall of seven. The enemy surround and attack it, but they are not able to take it. Now, to surround and attack it, there must have been vouchsafed to them by Heaven the opportunity of time, and in such case their not taking it is because opportunities of time vouchsafed by Heaven are not equal to advantages of situation afforded by the Earth.

There is a city, whose walls are distinguished for their height, and whose moats are distinguished for their depth, where the arms of its defenders, offensive and defensive, are distinguished for their strength and sharpness, and the stores of rice and other grain are very large. Yet it is obliged to be given up and abandoned. This is because advantages of situation afforded by the Earth are not equal to the union arising from the accord of Men.

In accordance with these principles it is said, "A people is bounded in, not by the limits of dykes and borders; a State is secured, not by the strengths of mountains and rivers; the kingdom is overawed, not by the sharpness and strength of arms."

When this ¡¤ the being assisted by few ¡¤ reaches its extreme point, his own relations revolt from the prince. When the being assisted by many reaches its highest point, the whole kingdom becomes obedient to the prince.

Chen Zhen asked Mencius, saying, 'Formerly, when you were in Qi, the king sent you a present Of 2,400 taels of fine silver, and you refused to accept it.

Mencius having gone to Ping Lu, addressed the governor of it, saying, 'If one of your spearmen should lose his place in the ranks three times in one day, would you, Sir, put him to death or not?'
èØ£º¡¸ÜôÓâß²¡£¡¹
'I would not wait for three times to do so,' was the reply.

Mencius went from Qi to Lu to bury his mother.

where Chong Yu begged to put a question to him, and said, 'Formerly, in ignorance of my incompetency, you employed me to superintend the making of the coffin. As you were then pressed by the urgency of the business, I did not venture to put any question to you. 
ĞÑêÃï¼êóôëå¥£ºÙÊå´ì¤Ú¸æÔ¡£¡¹
Now, however, I wish to take the liberty to submit the matter. The wood of the coffin, it appeared to me, was too good.'
èØ£º¡¸Í¯íºÎ²ÎªÙíÓø£¬ñéÍ¯Î²öÒõ»¡¢?öàñı£¬í»ô¸í­Ó¹åÚßîìÑ¡£
Mencius replied, 'Anciently, there was no rule for the size of either the inner or the outer coffin. In middle antiquity, the inner coffin was made seven inches thick, and the outer one the same. This was done by all, from the sovereign to the common people, 
ŞªòÁêÓÎºÚ¸å¥£¬æÔı­ò×åÚìÑãı¡£
and not simply for the beauty of the appearance, but because they thus satisfied the natural feelings of their hearts.

If prevented by statutory regulations from making their coffins in this way, men cannot have the feeling of pleasure. If they have not the money to make them in this way, they cannot have the feeling of pleasure. 
ÔğñıêÓêóî¯¡£
When they were not prevented, and had the money,

ğºìÑÛéæØ¡£
The people of Qi smote Yan.

Some one asked Mencius, saying, 'Is it really the case that you advised Qi to smite Yan?'

The second is gambling and chess¡¤playing, and being fond of wine, without attending to the nourishment of his parents. The third is being fond of goods and money, and selfishly attached to his wife and children, without attending to the nourishment of his parents.

Of the scholars of the kingdom there were multitudes who flocked to him. The sovereign designed that Shun should superintend the kingdom along with him, and then to transfer it to him entirely.

The reason why the being the object of men's delight, with the possession of beauty, riches, and honours were not sufficient to remove his sorrow, was that it could be removed only by his getting his parents to be in accord with him.

The desire of the child is towards his father and mother. When he becomes conscious of the attractions of beauty, his desire is towards young and beautiful women.

 Of all which a filial son can attain to, there is nothing greater than his honouring his parents. And of what can be attained to in the honouring one's parents, there is nothing greater than the nourishing them with the whole kingdom.

The words of the superior man do not go below the girdle, but great principles are contained in them.

The principle which the superior man holds is that of personal cultivation, but the kingdom is thereby tranquillized.

The scholars of my school are ambitious, but hasty. They are for advancing and seizing their object, but cannot forget their early ways."

 The ardent would advance to seize their object; the cautiously¡¤decided would keep themselves from certain things.

It is not to be thought that Confucius did not wish to get men pursuing the true medium,

'Why were they styled "ambitious?"'

When he found also that he could not get such as were thus ambitious, he wanted to get scholars who would consider anything impure as beneath them. Those were the cautiously¡¤decided,

Mencius replied, 'If you would blame them, you find nothing to allege. If you would criticise them, you have nothing to criticise. They agree with the current customs. They consent with an impure age. Their principles have a semblance of right¡¤heartedness and truth. Their conduct has a semblance of disinterestedness and purity. All men are pleased with them, and they think themselves right, so that it is impossible to proceed with them to the principles of Yao and Shun.

Confucius said, "I hate a semblance which is not the reality. I hate the darnel, lest it be confounded with the corn. I hate glib¡¤tonguedness, lest it be confounded with righteousness. I hate sharpness of tongue, lest it be confounded with sincerity. I hate the music of Chang, lest it be confounded with the true music. I hate the reddish blue, lest it be confounded with vermilion.

From Confucius downwards until now, there are only 100 years and somewhat more. The distance in time from the sage is so far from being remote, and so very near at hand was the sage's residence. In these circumstances, is there no one to transmit his doctrines?
