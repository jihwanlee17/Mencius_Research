Øëí­Ì¸ÕÙû³èİ¡£
Mencius went to see king Hui of Liang. 
èİèØ£º¡¸?Üô?ô¶×ìì»ÕÎ£¬æ²íâêóì¤××çîÏĞûº£¿¡¹
The king said, 'Venerable sir, since you have not counted it far to come here, a distance of a thousand li, may I presume that you are provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?'
Øëí­ÓßèØ£º¡¸èİù¼ù±èØ××£¿
Mencius replied, 'Why must your Majesty use that word "profit?" 
æ²êóìÒëùì»ì«ëø¡£
What I am provided with, are counsels to benevolence and righteousness, and these are my only topics. '
èİèØù¼ì¤××çîÏĞ£¿
If your Majesty say, "What is to be done to profit my kingdom?" 
ÓŞÜıèØù¼ì¤××çîÊ«£¿
the great officers will say, "What is to be done to profit our families?" 
ŞÍßîìÑèØù¼ì¤××çîãó£¿
and the inferior officers and the common people will say, "What is to be done to profit our persons?" 
ß¾ù»ÎßïÖ××£¬ì»ÏĞêËëø¡£
Superiors and inferiors will try to snatch this profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. 
Ø¿ã«ñıÏĞ£¬?ĞìÏÖíº£¬ù±ô¶ã«ñıÊ«£»ô¶ã«ñıÏĞ£¬?ĞìÏÖíº£¬ù±Ûİã«ñıÊ«¡£
In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his sovereign shall be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the kingdom of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his prince shall be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. 
Ø¿ö¢ô¶åê£¬ô¶ö¢Ûİåê£¬ÜôêÓÜôÒıëø¡£
To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be said not to be a large allotment, 
?êÓı­ëùì»à»××£¬Üô÷¬Üô?¡£
but if righteousness be put last, and profit be put first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all. 
Ú±êóìÒì»ë¶ĞìöÑíºå¥£»Ú±êóëùì»ı­ĞìÏÖíºå¥¡£
There never has been a benevolent man who neglected his parents. There never has been a righteous man who made his sovereign an after consideration. 
èİæ²èØìÒëùì»ì«ëø£¬ù¼ù±èØ××£¿¡¹
Let your Majesty also say, "Benevolence and righteousness, and let these be your only themes." Why must you use that word ¡¤ "profit?".'

Mencius, another day, saw King Hui of Liang. The king went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round at the large geese and deer, said, 'Do wise and good princes also find pleasure in these things?'
Øëí­ÓßèØ£º¡¸úçíºì»ı­äÅó®£»Üôúçíº£¬âÌêóó®£¬ÜôäÅå¥¡£
Mencius replied, 'Being wise and good, they have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure. 
ãÌéö£º¡ºÌèã·ÖÄÓæ£¬Ìèñıç½ñı¡£
It is said in the Book of Poetry, "He measured out and commenced his marvellous tower; He measured it out and planned it. 
ßîÚÅÍôñı£¬Üôìíà÷ñı¡£
The people addressed themselves to it, And in less than a day completed it. 
Ìèã·Ú¨?£¬ßîÚÅí­ÕÎ¡£
When he measured and began it, he said to them ¡¤ Be not so earnest: But the multitudes came as if they had been his children. 
èİî¤ÖÄ?£»?ÖãêòÜÑ¡£
The king was in his marvellous park; The does reposed about, 
?Öãöûöû£¬ÛÜğèùÍùÍ¡£
The does so sleek and fat: And the white birds came glistening. 
èİî¤ÖÄá»£¬åÚ?åàå¸¡£¡»
The king was by his marvellous pond; How full was it of fishes leaping about!" 
Ùşèİì¤ÚÅÕôêÓÓæêÓá»£¬ì»ÚÅü¶äÅñı£¬êİĞìÓæèØÖÄÓæ£¬êİĞìá»èØÖÄá»£»äÅĞìêó?ÖãåàÜ¯¡£
King Wen used the strength of the people to make his tower and his pond, and yet the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower "the marvellous tower," calling the pond "the marvellous pond," and rejoicing that he had his large deer, his fishes, and turtles. 
Í¯ñıìÑæ¨ÚÅú¥äÅ£¬ÍºÒöäÅå¥¡£
The ancients caused the people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it. 
÷·à¥èØ£º¡ºãÁìíúªßÃ£¿
In the Declaration of Tang it is said, "O sun, when wilt thou expire? 
åøĞàÒ³ËËØÌ¡£¡»
We will die together with thee." 
ÚÅé°æ¨ñıËËØÌ£¬âÌêóÓæò®ğèâ®£¬ÑÂÒöÔ¼äÅî££¿¡¹
The people wished for Jie's death, though they should die with him. Although he had towers, ponds, birds, and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?'

1¡¤4
ÕÙû³èİèØ£º¡¸ÍûìÑêÃäÌã¯?¡£¡¹
King Hui of Liang said, 'I wish quietly to receive your instructions.'
Øëí­ÓßèØ£º¡¸ß¯ìÑì¤ïØæ¨ìÓ£¬êóì¤ì¶ûº£¿¡¹
Mencius replied, 'Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword ?'
èØ£º¡¸Ùíì¤ì¶å¥¡£¡¹
The king said, 'There is no difference!'
¡¸ì¤ìÓæ¨ïÙ£¬êóì¤ì¶ûº£¿¡¹
'Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with the style of government?'
èØ£º¡¸Ùíì¤ì¶å¥¡£¡¹
'There is no difference,' was the reply.

Mencius then said, 'In your kitchen there is fat meat; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and on the wilds there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. 
â®ßÓãİ£¬ó¦ìÑäÂñı£»êÓÚÅİ«Ù½£¬ú¼ïÙÜôØóåÚáãâ®ì»ãİìÑ£¬äÂî¤ĞìêÓÚÅİ«Ù½å¥£¿
Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When a prince, being the parent of his people, administers his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is his parental relation to the people? 
ñêÒùèØ£º¡ºã·íÂéµíº£¬ĞìÙíı­ûº£¡¡»
Zhong Ni said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead?
êÓĞìßÚìÑì»éÄñıå¥¡£
So he said, because that man made the semblances of men, and used them for that purpose ¡¤ 
åıñıù¼ĞìŞÅŞÙÚÅÑÆì»Şİå¥£¿¡¹
what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?'
1¡¤5

King Hui of Liang said, 'There was not in the nation a stronger State than Jin, as you, venerable Sir, know.

But since it descended to me, on the east we have been defeated by Qi, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we have lost seven hundred li of territory to Qin; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Chu. 
ÍûìÑö»ñı£¬êÃİïŞİíºìì?ñı¡£
I have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away, once for all. 
åıñıù¼öÎÊ¦£¿¡¹
What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?'
Øëí­ÓßèØ£º¡¸ò¢Û°Ûİ×ì£¬ì»Ê¦ì¤èİ¡£
Mencius replied, 'With a territory which is only a hundred li square, it is possible to attain to the royal dignity.

If Your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding of them be carefully attended to, and that the strong¡¤bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal respectfulness, sincerity, and truthfulness, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors, you will then have a people who can be employed, with sticks which they have prepared, to oppose the strong mail and sharp weapons of the troops of Qin and Chu.

The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields, in order to support their parents. Their parents suffer from cold and hunger. Brothers, wives, and children are separated and scattered abroad. 
ù¨ùèÒüĞìÚÅ£¬èİèÙì»ïÖñı£¬ÜıâÁæ¨èİîØ£¿
Those rulers, as it were, drive their people into pit¡¤falls, or drown them. Your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty? 
ÍºèØ¡ºìÒíºÙíîØ¡»¡£
In accordance with this is the saying, "The benevolent has no enemy."
èİôëÚ¨ë÷¡£¡¹
 I beg your Majesty not to doubt what I say.'

Øëí­Ì¸ÕÙåÑèİ¡£
Mencius went to see the king Xiang of Liang. 
õó£¬åŞìÑèØ£º¡¸ØĞñıÜôŞÄìÑÏÖ£¬ö¦ñıì»ÜôÌ¸á¶èæåê¡£
On coming out from the interview, he said to some persons, 'When I looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a sovereign; when I drew near to him, I saw nothing venerable about him. 
ğïæÔÙıèØ£º¡ºô¸ù»äÂûºïÒ£¿¡»
Abruptly he asked me, "How can the kingdom be settled?" 
çîÓßèØ£º¡ºïÒéÍìé¡£¡»
I replied, "It will be settled by being united under one sway."
¡ºâÕÒöìéñı£¿¡»
'"Who can so unite it?" 
ÓßèØ£º¡ºÜôĞîß¯ìÑíºÒöìéñı¡£¡»
I replied, "He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it."'
¡ºâÕÒöæ¨ñı£¿¡»
'"Who can give it to him?" 
ÓßèØ£º¡ºô¸ù»Ø°Üôæ¨å¥¡£
I replied, " All the people of the nation will unanimously give it to him. 
èİò±ÜıÙàûº£¿
Does your Majesty understand the way of the growing grain? 
öÒ¡¢ø¢êÅñıÊàùÑ£¬öÎÙàÍ¾ëø¡£
During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. 
ô¸êúæÔíÂê££¬ø©æÔù»éë£¬öÎÙà?æÔıéñıëø¡£
Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, they send down torrents of rain, and the grain erects itself, as if by a shoot. 
ĞìåıãÀ£¬âÕÒöåİñı£¿
When it does so, who can keep it back?

Now among the shepherds of men throughout the nation, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people in the nation would look towards him with outstretched necks. 
á¤åıãÀå¥£¬ÚÅÏıñıë¦â©ñıö¦ù»ø©æÔ£¬âÁÒöåİñı£¿¡»¡¹
Such being indeed the case, the people would flock to him, as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress."'

ğºà¾èİÙıèØ£º¡¸ğºü¸¡¢òËÙşñıŞÀ£¬Ê¦ÔğÚ¤ûº£¿¡¹
The king Xuan of Qi asked, saying, 'May I be informed by you of the transactions of Huan of Qi, and Wen of Jin?'
Øëí­ÓßèØ£º¡¸ñêÒùñıÓùÙíÔ³ü¸¡¢ÙşñıŞÀíº£¬ãÀì¤ı­?Ùíîîåê£¬ãíÚ±ñıÚ¤å¥¡£
Mencius replied, 'There were none of the disciples of Zhong Ni who spoke about the affairs of Huan and Wen, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after¡¤ages ¡¤ your servant has not heard them. 
Ùíì¤£¬öÎèİûº£¿¡¹
If you will have me speak, let it be about royal government.'
èØ£º¡¸Óìù¼åı£¬öÎÊ¦ì¤èİëø£¿¡¹
The king said, 'What virtue must there be in order to attain to royal sway?'
èØ£º¡¸ÜÁÚÅì»èİ£¬Ø°ñıÒöåİå¥¡£¡¹
Mencius answered, 'The love and protection of the people; with this there is no power which can prevent a ruler from attaining to it.'
èØ£º¡¸å´ÍûìÑíº£¬Ê¦ì¤ÜÁÚÅûºî££¿¡¹
The king asked again, 'Is such an one as I competent to love and protect the people?'
èØ£º¡¸Ê¦¡£¡¹
Mencius said, 'Yes.'
èØ£º¡¸ù¼ë¦ò±çîÊ¦å¥£¿¡¹
'How do you know that I am competent for that?'
èØ£º¡¸ãíÚ¤ñıû×?èØ£º¡ºèİñ¦åÚÓÑß¾£¬êóÌ²éÚì»Î¦ÓÑù»íº¡£
'I heard the following incident from Hu He: "The king," said he, "was sitting aloft in the hall, when a man appeared, leading an ox past the lower part of it. 
èİÌ¸ñıèØ£º¡¸éÚù¼ñı£¿¡¹
The king saw him, and asked, Where is the ox going? 
ÓßèØ£º¡¸íâì¤?ñ£¡£¡¹
The man replied, We are going to consecrate a bell with its blood. 
èİèØ£º¡¸Şìñı£¡
The king said, Let it go. 
çîÜôìÛĞì??£¬å´Ùíñªì»ö¦Şİò¢¡£¡¹
I cannot bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death. 
ÓßèØ£º¡¸æÔöÎøÈ?ñ£æ¨£¿¡¹
The man answered, Shall we then omit the consecration of the bell ? 
èØ£º¡¸ù¼Ê¦øÈå¥£¿
The king said, How can that be omitted? 
ì¤åÏæ¶ñı¡£¡¹
Change it for a sheep." 
ÜôãÛêóğ³£¿¡¹
I do not know whether this incident really occurred.'
èØ£º¡¸êóñı¡£¡¹
The king replied, 'It did,'
èØ£º¡¸ãÀãığëì¤èİëø¡£
and then Mencius said, 'The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the royal sway. 
ÛİàóËËì¤èİêÓäñå¥£»ãíÍ³ò±èİñıÜôìÛå¥¡£¡¹
The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely, that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight, which made you do as you did.'
èİèØ£º¡¸æÔ¡£
The king said, 'You are right. 
á¤êóÛİàóíº£¬ğºÏĞâÌ?á³£¬çîù¼äñìééÚ£¿
And yet there really was an appearance of what the people condemned. But though Qi be a small and narrow State, how should I grudge one ox? 
?ÜôìÛĞì??£¬å´Ùíñªì»ö¦Şİò¢£¬Íºì¤åÏæ¶ñıå¥¡£¡¹
Indeed it was because I could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore I changed it for a sheep.'
èØ£º¡¸èİÙíì¶åÚÛİàóñıì¤èİêÓäñå¥¡£
Mencius pursued, 'Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you were grudging the animal. 
ì¤á³æ¶ÓŞ£¬ù¨äÂò±ñı£¿
When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? 
èİå´ëßĞìÙíñªì»ö¦Şİò¢£¬öÎéÚåÏù¼÷Éåê£¿¡¹
If you felt pained by its being led without guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between an ox and a sheep?
èİáÅèØ£º¡¸ãÀá¤ù¼ãıî££¿
The king laughed and said, 'What really was my mind in the matter? 
ä²ŞªäñĞìî¯ì»æ¶ñıì¤åÏå¥¡£
I did not grudge the expense of it, and changed it for a sheep!
ëñûºÛİàóñıêİä²äñå¥£¡¡¹
 There was reason in the people's saying that I grudged it.'
èØ£º¡¸Ùíß¿å¥£¬ãÀÒ¬ìÒâúå¥¡£
'There is no harm in their saying so,' said Mencius. 'Your conduct was an artifice of benevolence. 
Ì¸éÚÚ±Ì¸åÏå¥¡£
You saw the ox, and had not seen the sheep.

So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die; having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. 
ãÀì¤ÏÖí­??ñ·å¥¡£¡¹
Therefore he keeps away from his slaughter¡¤house and cook¡¤room.'
èİàã£¬èØ£º¡¸ãÌéö£º¡ºöâìÑêóãı£¬åøõ¼Óøñı¡»£¬Üıí­ñıêİå¥¡£
The king was pleased, and said, 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, "The minds of others, I am able by reflection to measure;" ¡¤ this is verified, my Master, in your discovery of my motive.

I indeed did the thing, but when I turned my thoughts inward, and examined into it, I could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. 
ó®ãıñıá¶ì¤ùêåÚèİíº£¬ù¼å¥£¿¡¹
How is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the royal sway?'

Mencius replied, 'Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty: "My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but it is not sufficient to lift one feather; my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but I do not see a waggon¡¤load of faggots;" 
öÎèİúÉñıûº£¿¡¹

'No,' was the answer,

on which Mencius proceeded, 'Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and no benefits are extended from it to the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here?

The truth is, the feather is not lifted, because strength is not used; the waggon¡¤load of firewood is not seen, because the eyesight is not used; and the people are not loved and protected, because kindness is not employed. 
ÍºèİñıÜôèİ£¬ÜôêÓå¥¡£
Therefore your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway, is because you do not do it, 
ŞªÜôÒöå¥¡£¡¹
not because you are not able to do it.'
èØ£º¡¸ÜôêÓíºæ¨ÜôÒöíºñıû¡ù¼ì¤ì¶£¿¡¹
The king asked, 'How may the difference between the not doing a thing, and the not being able to do it, be represented?

In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people "I am not able to do it," that is a case of not doing it, it is not a case of not being able to do it.

Therefore your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway, is not such a case as that of taking the Tai mountain under your arm, and leaping over the north sea with it. Your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree.

It is said in the Book of Poetry, "His example affected his wife. It reached to his brothers, and his family of the State was governed by it."  The language shows how king Wen simply took his kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties.

Therefore the carrying out his kindness of heart by a prince will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas, and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children.

By weighing, we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring, we know what things are long, and what short.

You collect your equipments of war, endanger your soldiers and officers, and excite the resentment of the other princes ¡¤ do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?'

How should I derive pleasure from these things?

The king laughed and did not speak.

Mencius resumed, 'Are you led to desire it, because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? 
ÌîÑîÜôğëåÚô÷æ¨£¿
Or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body?

Or because you have not enough of attendants and favourites to stand before you and receive your orders? 
èİñığ³ãíËËğëì¤Íêñı£¬ì»èİÑÂêÓãÀî££¿¡¹
Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with those things. How can your Majesty be led to entertain such a desire on account of them?'

'No,' said the king; 'my desire is not on account of them.'

The scholar Gao had attained to an unperturbed mind at an earlier period of life than I did.'

Bei Gong You had this way of nourishing his valour: He did not flinch from any strokes at his body. He did not turn his eyes aside from any thrusts at them.

He considered that the slightest push from any one was the same as if he were beaten before the crowds in the market¡¤place,

and that what he would not receive from a common man in his loose large garments of hair, neither should he receive from a prince of ten thousand chariots. 
ãÊÕ·Ø¿ã«ñıÏÖå´Õ·ÊèÜı¡£
He viewed stabbing a prince of ten thousand chariots just as stabbing a fellow dressed in cloth of hair.

Meng Shi She had this way of nourishing his valour: He said, "I look upon not conquering and conquering in the same way.

To measure the enemy and then advance; to calculate the chances of victory and then engage ¡¤ this is to stand in awe of the opposing force.

How can I make certain of conquering? 
ÒöÙíÏ«ì»ì«ëø¡£¡»
I can only rise superior to all fear." 
Øëã¿ŞìŞÄñôí­£¬İÁÏà?ŞÄí­ù¾¡£
Meng Shi She resembled the philosopher Zeng. Bei Gong You resembled Zi Xia.

I do not know to the valour of which of the two the superiority should be ascribed, but yet Meng Shi She attended to what was of the greater importance. 
à®íºñôí­êİí­åÑèØ£º¡ºí­û¿é¸ûº£¿
Formerly, the philosopher Zeng said to Zi Xiang, "Do you love valour?

I heard an account of great valour from the Master. It speaks thus: 'If, on self¡¤examination, I find that I am not upright, shall I not be in fear even of a poor man in his loose garments of hair¡¤cloth? If, on self¡¤examination, I find that I am upright, I will go forward against thousands and tens of thousands.' 
Øëã¿ŞìñıáúÑ¨£¬éÑÜôåıñôí­ñıáúå³å¥¡£¡¹
Yet, what Meng Shi She maintained, being merely his physical energy, was after all inferior to what the philosopher Zeng maintained, which was indeed of the most importance.'
èØ£º¡¸ÊòÙıÜıí­ñıÜôÔÑãıæ¨Í±í­ñıÜôÔÑãı£¬Ê¦ÔğÚ¤æ¨£¿¡¹
Gong Sun Chou said, 'May I venture to ask an explanation from you, Master, of how you maintain an unperturbed mind, and how the philosopher Gao does the same?'
¡¸Í±í­èØ£º¡ºÜôÔğåÚåë£¬Ú¨Ï´åÚãı£»ÜôÔğåÚãı£¬Ú¨Ï´åÚÑ¨¡£¡»
Mencius answered, 'Gao says, "What is not attained in words is not to be sought for in the mind; what produces dissatisfaction in the mind, is not to be helped by passion¡¤effort." 
ÜôÔğåÚãı£¬Ú¨Ï´åÚÑ¨£¬Ê¦£»ÜôÔğåÚåë£¬Ú¨Ï´åÚãı£¬ÜôÊ¦¡£
This last, when there is unrest in the mind, not to seek for relief from passion¡¤effort, may be conceded. But not to seek in the mind for what is not attained in words cannot be conceded.

The will is the leader of the passion¡¤nature. The passion¡¤nature pervades and animates the body.

The will is first and chief, and the passion¡¤nature is subordinate to it. 
ÍºèØ£ºò¥Ğìò¤£¬ÙíøìĞìÑ¨¡£¡¹

èØ£º¡¸ò¤ììöÎÔÑÑ¨£»Ñ¨ììöÎÔÑò¤å¥¡£
Mencius replied, 'When it is the will alone which is active, it moves the passion¡¤nature. When it is the passion¡¤nature alone which is active, it moves the will. 
ĞÑÜıÏóíºõÙíºãÀÑ¨å¥ì»ÚãÔÑĞìãı¡£¡¹
For instance now, in the case of a man falling or running, that is from the passion¡¤nature, and yet it moves the mind.'
¡¸ÊòÙıÜıí­äÂûºíş£¿¡¹
'I venture to ask,' said Chou again, 'wherein you, Master, surpass Gao.'
èØ£º¡¸ä²ò±åë£¬ä²à¼å×çîûÇæÔñıÑ¨¡£¡¹
Mencius told him, 'I understand words. I am skilful in nourishing my vast, flowing passion¡¤nature.'
¡¸ÊòÙıù¼êİûÇæÔñıÑ¨£¿¡¹
Chou pursued, 'I venture to ask what you mean by your vast, flowing passion¡¤nature!'
èØ£º¡¸Ññåëå¥¡£
The reply was, 'It is difficult to describe it. 
ĞìêÓÑ¨å¥ò¸ÓŞò¸Ë§£¬ì¤òÁå×ì»Ùíúª£¬öÎßİéÍô¸ò¢ñıÊà¡£
This is the passion¡¤nature: It is exceedingly great, and exceedingly strong. Being nourished by rectitude, and sustaining no injury, it fills up all between heaven and earth. 
ĞìêÓÑ¨å¥ÛÕëùæ¨Ô³£¬ÙíãÀ?å¥¡£
This is the passion¡¤nature: It is the mate and assistant of righteousness and reason. Without it, man is in a state of starvation.

It is produced by the accumulation of righteous deeds; it is not to be obtained by incidental acts of righteousness.

If the mind does not feel complacency in the conduct, the nature becomes starved.

There must be the constant practice of this righteousness, but without the object of thereby nourishing the passion¡¤nature. Let not the mind forget its work, but let there be no assisting the growth of that nature.

Let us not be like the man of Song.

There was a man of Song, who was grieved that his growing corn was not longer, and so he pulled it up. Having done this, he returned home, looking very stupid, and said to his people, "I am tired today. I have been helping the corn to grow long." 
Ğìí­õÙì»èÙãÊñı£¬ÙàöÎÍ¾ëø¡£
His son ran to look at it, and found the corn all withered. 
ô¸ù»ñıÜôğ¾ÙàíşíºÍûëø¡£
There are few in the world, who do not deal with their passion¡¤nature, as if they were assisting the corn to grow long. 
ì¤êÓÙíìÌì»Şìñıíº£¬ÜôéüÙàíºå¥¡£

They who assist it to grow long, pull out their corn. What they do is not only of no benefit to the nature, but it also injures it.'

Gong Sun Chou further asked, 'What do you mean by saying that you understand whatever words you hear?'

Mencius replied, 'When words are one¡¤sided, I know how the mind of the speaker is clouded over. When words are extravagant, I know how the mind is fallen and sunk.

On this Chou observed, 'Zai Wo and Zi Gong were skilful in speaking. Ran Niu, the disciple Min, and Yan Yuan, while their words were good, were distinguished for their virtuous conduct. Confucius united the qualities of the disciples in himself, but still he said, "In the matter of speeches, I am not competent." 
æÔöÎÜıí­?á¡ëøûº£¿¡¹
Then, Master, have you attained to be a Sage?'

à®íºí­ÍøÙıåÚÍîí­èØ£º¡ºÜıí­á¡ëøûº£¿¡»
Formerly Zi Gong asked Confucius, saying, "Master, are you a Sage?"

Zi Gong said, "You learn without satiety ¡¤ that shows your wisdom. You teach without being tired ¡¤ that shows your benevolence.

Benevolent and wise ¡¤ Master, you ARE a Sage."

Chou said, 'Formerly, I once heard this: Zi Xia, Zi You, and Zi Zhang had each one member of the Sage. Ran Niu, the disciple Min, and Yan Yuan had all the members, but in small proportions. I venture to ask, With which of these are you pleased to rank yourself?'
èØ£º¡¸Í´ŞìãÀ¡£¡¹
Mencius replied, 'Let us drop speaking about these, if you please.'
èØ£º¡¸Û×ì¨¡¢ì¥ëÅù¼åı£¿¡¹

'Their ways were different from mine,' said Mencius.

'Not to serve a prince whom he did not esteem, nor command a people whom he did not approve; in a time of good government to take office, and on the occurrence of confusion to retire ¡¤ this was the way of Bo Yi.

The reply was, 'Yes. If they had been sovereigns over a hundred li of territory, they would, all of them, have brought all the princes to attend in their court, and have obtained the throne.

In those things they agreed with him.'

Mencius said, 'He who, using force, makes a pretence to benevolence is the leader of the princes. A leader of the princes requires a large kingdom. He who, using virtue, practises benevolence is the sovereign of the kingdom. To become the sovereign of the kingdom, a prince need not wait for a large kingdom. Tang did it with only seventy li, and king Wen with only a hundred.

When one by force subdues men, they do not submit to him in heart. They submit, because their strength is not adequate to resist. When one subdues men by virtue, in their hearts' core they are pleased, and sincerely submit, as was the case with the seventy disciples in their submission to Confucius. 
¡¶ãÌ¡·éö£º¡ºí»à¤í»ÔÔ£¬í»Ñõí»İÁ£¬ÙíŞÖÜôÜ×¡£¡»
What is said in the Book of Poetry, "From the west, from the east, From the south, from the north, There was not one who thought of refusing submission,"

is an illustration of this.'
Øëí­èØ£º¡¸ìÒöÎç´£¬ÜôìÒöÎé´¡£
Mencius said, 'Benevolence brings glory to a prince, and the opposite of it brings disgrace. 
ĞÑäÂé´ì»ËÜÜôìÒ£¬ãÀë¢äÂã¥ì»ËÜù»å¥¡£
For the princes of the present day to hate disgrace and yet to live complacently doing what is not benevolent, is like hating moisture and yet living in a low situation.

If a prince hates disgrace, the best course for him to pursue, is to esteem virtue and honour virtuous scholars,

giving the worthiest among them places of dignity, and the able offices of trust. When throughout his kingdom there is leisure and rest from external troubles, let him, taking advantage of such a season, clearly digest the principles of his government with its legal sanctions, and then even great kingdoms will be constrained to stand in awe of him. 
¡¶ãÌ¡·éö£º¡º?ô¸ñıÚ±ëäéë£¬ôËù¨ßÍ÷Ï£¬ñÆÙğ?ûÂ¡£
It is said in the Book of Poetry, "Before the heavens were dark with rain, I gathered the bark from the roots of the mulberry trees, And wove it closely to form the window and door of my nest;

Now, I thought, ye people below, Perhaps ye will not dare to insult me." 
Íîí­èØ£º¡ºêÓó®ãÌíº£¬Ğìò±Ô³ûº£¡
Confucius said, "Did not he who made this ode understand the way of governing?"

If a prince is able rightly to govern his kingdom, who will dare to insult him? 
ĞÑÏĞÊ«ÊàÊ¬£¬ĞàãÀãÁÚõäÅ÷½çù£¬ãÀí»Ï´ü¡å¥¡£
But now the princes take advantage of the time when throughout their kingdoms there is leisure and rest from external troubles, to abandon themselves to pleasure and indolent indifference ¡¤ they in fact seek for calamities for themselves.

Calamity and happiness in all cases are men's own seeking. 
¡¶ãÌ¡·éö£º¡ºçµåëÛÕÙ¤£¬í»Ï´ÒıÜØ¡£¡»

He would not stand in a bad prince's court, nor speak with a bad man. To stand in a bad prince's court, or to speak with a bad man, would have been to him the same as to sit with his court robes and court cap amid mire and ashes.

Pursuing the examination of his dislike to what was evil, we find that he thought it necessary, if he happened to be standing with a villager whose cap was not rightly adjusted, to leave him with a high air, as if he were going to be defiled.

Therefore, although some of the princes made application to him with very proper messages, he would not receive their gifts.

He would not receive their gifts, counting it inconsistent with his purity to go to them.

Hui of Liu Xia was not ashamed to serve an impure prince, nor did he think it low to be an inferior officer.

When advanced to employment, he did not conceal his virtue, but made it a point to carry out his principles.

He would remain in office, when pressed to do so, not counting it required by his purity to go away.'

Now shall we say that these sentiments are not right?

In the kingdom there are three things universally acknowledged to be honourable. Nobility is one of them; age is one of them; virtue is one of them.

In courts, nobility holds the first place of the three; in villages, age holds the first place; and for helping one's generation and presiding over the people, the other two are not equal to virtue.

Accordingly, there was the behaviour of Tang to Yi Yin: he first learned of him, and then employed him as his minister; and so without difficulty he became sovereign. There was the behaviour of the duke Huan to Guan Zhong: he first learned of him, and then employed him as his minister; and so without difficulty he became chief of all the princes. Now throughout the kingdom, the territories of the princes are of equal extent, and in their achievements they are on a level.

Not one of them is able to exceed the others. This is from no other reason, but that they love to make ministers of those whom they teach, and do not love to make ministers of those by whom they might be taught.

When Mencius had left Qi, Yin Shi spoke about him to others, saying, 'If he did not know that the king could not be made a Tang or a Wu, that showed his want of intelligence. If he knew that he could not be made such, and came notwithstanding, that shows he was seeking his own benefit.

The disciple Gao informed Mencius of these remarks.

The duke Wen of Teng asked Mencius about the proper way of governing a kingdom. 
Øëí­èØ£º¡¸ÚÅŞÀÜôÊ¦èĞå¥¡£
Mencius said, 'The business of the people may not be remissly attended to. 
¡¶ãÌ¡·éö£º¡ºñ¸ì³éÍÙÆ£¬á²ì³ßã?¡£
It is said in the Book of Poetry, "In the day¡¤light go and gather the grass, And at night twist your ropes;

If they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self¡¤abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. 
ĞàùèûºñªæÔı­ğôì»úıñı£¬ãÀØÒÚÅå¥¡£
When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them ¡¤ this is to entrap the people.

'The sovereign of the Xia dynasty enacted the fifty mu allotment, and the payment of a tax. The founder of the Yin enacted the seventy mu allotment, and the system of mutual aid. The founder of the Zhou enacted the hundred mu allotment, and the share system.

In reality, what was paid in all these was a tithe.

In good years, when the grain lies about in abundance, much might be taken without its being oppressive, and the actual exaction would be small. But in bad years, the produce being not sufficient to repay the manuring of the fields, this system still requires the taking of the full amount.

It is only in the system of mutual aid that there is a public field,

On occasions of death, or removal from one dwelling to another, there will be no quitting the district.

and, on his wife's asking him with whom he ate and drank, they were sure to be all wealthy and honourable people.

The wife informed the concubine, saying, 'When our good man goes out, he is sure to come back having partaken plentifully of wine and flesh.

I asked with whom he ate and drank, and they are all, it seems, wealthy and honourable people. And yet no people of distinction ever come here.

Accordingly, she got up early in the morning, and privately followed wherever her husband went.

At last, he came to those who were sacrificing among the tombs beyond the outer wall on the east, and begged what they had over. Not being satisfied, he looked about, and went to another party ¡¤ and this was the way in which he got himself satiated. 
Ğìô£Ïı£¬Í±ĞìôİèØ£º¡¸ÕŞìÑíº£¬á¶äæØĞì»ğûãóå¥¡£
His wife returned, and informed the concubine, saying, 'It was to our husband that we looked up in hopeful contemplation, with whom our lot is cast for life ¡¤
ĞÑå´ó®£¡¡¹
 and now these are his ways!' 
æ¨Ğìôİ?ĞìÕŞìÑì»ßÓëèåÚñéïÔ¡£
On this, along with the concubine she reviled their husband, and they wept together in the middle hall.

In the meantime the husband, knowing nothing of all this, came in with a jaunty air, carrying himself proudly to his wife and concubine.

In the view of a superior man, as to the ways by which men seek for riches, honours, gain, and advancement, there are few of their wives and concubines who would not be ashamed and weep together on account of them.

Wan Zhang asked Mencius, saying, 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, "In marrying a wife, how ought a man to proceed? 
ù±Í±İ«Ù½¡£¡»
He must inform his parents." 
ãáŞÙåëå¥£¬ëñØ°åıâï¡£
If the rule be indeed as here expressed, no man ought to have illustrated it so well as Shun.

How was it that Shun's marriage took place without his informing his parents?'
Øëí­èØ£º¡¸Í±öÎÜôÔğö¥¡£
Mencius replied, 'If he had informed them, he would not have been able to marry. 
ÑûÒ³ËÜãø£¬ìÑñıÓŞ×Ãå¥¡£
That male and female should dwell together, is the greatest of human relations. 
åıÍ±öÎøÈìÑñıÓŞ×Ãì¤?İ«Ù½£¬ãÀì¤ÜôÍ±å¥¡£¡¹
If Shun had informed his parents, he must have made void this greatest of human relations, thereby incurring their resentment. On this account, he did not inform them!'
Ø¿íñèØ£º¡¸âïñıÜôÍ±ì»ö¥£¬öÎçî?ÔğÚ¤Ù¤ëø¡£
Wan Zhang said, 'As to Shun's marrying without informing his parents, I have heard your instructions; 
ğ¨ñıô£âïì»ÜôÍ±£¬ù¼å¥£¿¡¹
but how was it that the Di Yao gave him his daughters as wives without informing Shun's parents?'
èØ£º¡¸ğ¨æ²ò±Í±åêöÎÜôÔğô£å¥¡£¡¹
Mencius said, 'The Di also knew that if he informed them, he could not marry his daughters to him.'

Wan Zhang said, 'His parents set Shun to repair a granary, to which, the ladder having been removed, Gu Sou set fire.

They also made him dig a well. He got out, but they, not knowing that, proceeded to cover him up.

Xiang then went away into Shun's palace, and there was Shun on his couch playing on his lute.

Xiang said, "I am come simply because I was thinking anxiously about you." 
??¡£
At the same time, he blushed deeply. 
âïèØ£º¡ºêæ?ãíßî£¬æ£ĞìéÍåøö½¡£¡»
Shun said to him, "There are all my officers ¡¤ do you undertake the government of them for me."
ÜôãÛâïÜôò±ßÚñıíâß¯Ğùæ¨£¿¡¹
 I do not know whether Shun was ignorant of Xiang's wishing to kill him.'
èØ£º¡¸ú¨ì»Üôò±å¥£¡
Mencius answered, 'How could he be ignorant of that? 
ßÚéØæ²éØ£¬ßÚıìæ²ıì¡£¡¹
But when Xiang was sorrowful, he was also sorrowful; when Xiang was joyful, he was also joyful.'
èØ£º¡¸æÔöÎâï?ıìíºæ¨£¿¡¹
Zhang said, 'In that case, then, did not Shun rejoice hypocritically?'

Mencius replied, 'No.

Formerly, some one sent a present of a live fish to Zi Chan of Zhang. Zi Chan ordered his pond¡¤keeper to keep it in the pond,

but that officer cooked it, and reported the execution of his commission, saying, "When I first let it go, it embarrassed. In a little while, it seemed to be somewhat at ease, then it swam away joyfully." 
í­?èØ£º¡ºÔğĞìá¶î££¡
Zi Chan observed, "It had got into its element!

It had got into its element!"
ÎèìÑõó£¬èØ£º¡ºâÕêİí­?òª£¿
 The pond¡¤keeper then went out and said, "Who calls Zi Chan a wise man?

After I had cooked and eaten the fish, he says, "It had got into its element!

Xiang came in the way in which the love of his elder brother would have made him come; therefore Shun sincerely believed him, and rejoiced.

Wan Zhang said, 'Xiang made it his daily business to slay Shun. When Shun was made sovereign, how was it that he only banished him?'
Øëí­èØ£º¡¸Üæñıå¥¡£
Mencius said, 'He raised him to be a prince.

Wan Zhang said, 'Shun banished the superintendent of works to You Zhou; he sent away Huan Dou to the mountain Chong; he slew the prince of San Miao in San Wei; and he imprisoned Gun on the mountain Yu. When the crimes of those four were thus punished, the whole kingdom acquiesced ¡¤ 
ñÊÜôìÒå¥¡£
it was a cutting off of men who were destitute of benevolence.

But Xiang was of all men the most destitute of benevolence, and Shun raised him to be the prince of You Bei ¡¤ 
êó?ñıìÑú¨ñªåê£¿
of what crimes had the people of You Bei been guilty? 
ìÒìÑÍ³åıãÀûº£¿
Does a benevolent man really act thus?

èØ£º¡¸ìÒìÑñıåÚğ©å¥£¬ÜôíúÒÁåê£¬ÜôâÖê³åê£¬öÑäññıì»ì«ëø¡£

öÑñı£¬é°ĞìÏşå¥£»äññı£¬é°Ğìİ£å¥¡£
Regarding him with affection, he wishes him to be honourable: regarding him with love, he wishes him to be rich.

The appointment of Xiang to be the prince of You Bei was to enrich and ennoble him. 
ãóêÓô¸í­£¬ğ©êÓù¯Üı£¬Ê¦êİöÑäññıûº£¿¡¹
If while Shun himself was sovereign, his brother had been a common man, could he have been said to regard him with affection and love?'

Mencius replied, 'Xiang could do nothing in his State. The Son of Heaven appointed an officer to administer its government, and to pay over its revenues to him. This treatment of him led to its being said that he was banished.

How indeed could he be allowed the means of oppressing the people?

Wan Zhang said, 'Was it the case that Yao gave the throne to Shun?'
Øëí­èØ£º¡¸Üú£¬ô¸í­ÜôÒöì¤ô¸ù»æ¨ìÑ¡£¡¹

Yes ¡¤ but Shun had the throne. Who gave it to him?'
èØ£º¡¸ô¸æ¨ñı¡£¡¹
'Heaven gave it to him,' was the answer.

'" Heaven gave it to him:" ¡¤ did Heaven confer its appointment on him with specific injunctions?'
èØ£º¡¸Üú£¬ô¸Üôåë£¬ì¤ú¼æ¨ŞÀãÆñıì»ì«ëø¡£¡¹
Mencius replied, 'No. Heaven does not speak. It simply showed its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs.'

"It showed its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs" ¡¤ how was this?'

Mencius's answer was, 'The sovereign can present a man to Heaven, but he cannot make Heaven give that man the throne. A prince can present a man to the sovereign, but he cannot cause the sovereign to make that man a prince. A great officer can present a man to his prince, but he cannot cause the prince to make that man a great officer. 
à®íºèëôÀâïåÚô¸ì»ô¸áôñı£¬øìñıåÚÚÅì»ÚÅáôñı¡£

The princes of the kingdom, however, repairing to court, went not to the son of Yao, but they went to Shun. Litigants went not to the son of Yao, but they went to Shun. Singers sang not the son of Yao, but they sang Shun. Therefore I said, "Heaven gave him the throne."

 If he had, before these things, taken up his residence in the palace of Yao, and had applied pressure to the son of Yao, it would have been an act of usurpation, and not the gift of Heaven.
